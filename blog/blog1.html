            "Cho toi xin mot ve di tuoi tho" (Give me a ticket back to childhood) by Nguyen Nhat Anh is my favorite book from childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            For all that, I could never identify myself with the boy (Mui) in the story.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            Growing up in a middle-class family that would give me everything I ever asked for and shield me from smallest dangers, I find it difficult to imagine myself doing all the "crazy" things Mui does. I could never see myself "stealing the family's bread to feed stray dogs", or "digging up our neighbors' yard to find hidden treasures". I was never encouraged to step beyond my comfort zone. I never learned to fight for what I believed in, like Mui does.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Yet, it is the <em>vast</em> difference between me and Mui that continuously drew me to the story. I find Mui's experience so strange, otherly, and alluring.
        </p>
        <p> 
            In some way, I aspired to have the guts to embark on risky adventures without adults' permission. I aspired to play "chase" (ruot duoi) and then "wrestle" with my friends until our eyes were black and our elbows were bruised. I aspired to be the naughty kid who always sat at the back of the class, arguing and fighting with others over trivial matters (that were, actually, of the highest importance for kids like us). I aspired to rebel against mathematical rules, refusing to accept that 5 times 3 must be 15.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I <em>aspired to be Mui </em>.
        </p>
        <p> 
            "Cho toi xin mot ve di tuoi tho" does not give me a ticket back to my childhood, but a ticket to a world that I never lived in, friends that I never made, and adventures that I never took. I love "Cho toi xin mot ve di tuoi tho" not because Mui's experience bears similarities to my own story as a kid. Instead, I cherish this book because Mui's experience reminded me of a longing, or perhaps, a nostalgia, for the childhood that I never experienced.

            It has been 10 years since I finished this book. I should pick it up again soon.
