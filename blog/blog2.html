        <h1>  My response to a St. John's College's supplemental prompt </h1>
        <p> <strong>Prompt</strong>: Discuss a book that has particular significance for you. What makes this book great in your
        view? What effect does it have on what you think or how you think? </p>
        <p> <strong> My response</strong>: </p>

            <em>On Tolerance: A Defense of Moral Independence</em> by Frank Furedi is the book that completely changed
approach to opinions with which I disagree. In this book, Furedi makes the case for the classical liberal
notion of “tolerance”, as opposed to its conceptual reinvention in contemporary politics, which has
come to mean acceptance of group identities and a “non-judgmental” attitude towards cultural
viewpoints.
        </p>

            He delineates the original term as “involved an act of judgment and discrimination; but judgment did
not serve as a prelude to censoring another person’s wrong views, because tolerance demands respect
for people’s right to hold beliefs in accordance with their conscience”. For example, I can judge and find
myself in utter disagreement, or even abhorrence, with your viewpoint, but I will, as the French
philosopher Voltaire famously put it, “defend to the death your right to say it”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furedi then brings forth two arguments to substantiate this concept of “tolerance”. He argues that
tolerance allows for the examination of new ideas, which fosters the vibrant dynamic of intellectual
growth of a society. This concern for the testing of novel opinions stems from epistemological
uncertainty, that is, how little one could know for sure that his opinion is true and that of his contender
is false. We have seen many scientific theories debunked: people used to believe in a geocentric
universe, now scientists have proved that the Earth and other planets orbit around the Sun. When
contemporary knowledge is unable to retain its inviolable authority, instead constantly being challenged
and subverted, it’s alluring to be skeptical of the truth of our opinions. And in fact, we are all wrong
about something, at some point in our life; and because of this intellectual fallibility, Furedi believes that
we need to allow tolerance to temper “the negative consequences of uncertainty through creating the
conditions for gaining greater clarity”. We need others to criticize our viewpoints so that we know when
we are in error, and then orient ourselves towards the more substantiated position. Even in the case
when we are right, at least what doesn’t kill us make us stronger: we learn to affirm our values in a
deeper and more thoughtful way as a result of the intense engagement with opposing perspectives.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            This profound reflection is the second argument that he makes for the necessity of tolerance. Without
thoughtful deliberation, a true belief cannot be deemed “knowledge”. If someone correctly believes
that one plus one equals two, but doesn’t know the process of arriving at that conclusion, that’s no
different from not knowing anything at all. Only after one thinks deeply about how mathematical
addition works will one attain true knowledge of the calculation. The same goes with making value
judgments of others’ opinions. The way by which we gain knowledge must involve a relentless struggle
against other incompatible perspectives. We must tolerate them by allowing people to speak their
thoughts, at the same time, judging and discriminating these thoughts on logical grounds. Therefore, the

case Furedi makes for tolerance is twofold: tolerance allows the society to receive as many opinions as
possible, hence increasing the likelihood of attaining truths, while also helping individuals internalize
and reflect on their beliefs.

            While the author appraises the classical liberal notion of tolerance, he critiques the new concept of
“tolerance” as used in contemporary politics. Nowadays, tolerance, the author claims, “is frequently
used as a companion term with ‘inclusive’ or ‘non-judgmental’”. His problem with this recent
conceptualization of tolerance is that it encourages intellectual indifference and laziness. Instead of
allowing judgment and discrimination to see whether others’ opinions are true or not, tolerance “has
become a way of not taking them seriously”. This understanding of tolerance undermines the search for
Truth, instead positing that to speak against certain viewpoints is bigoted, ignorant, and ironically,
intolerant. When all judgments are suspended, there is no clash between ideas, hence, no new
knowledge can be gained. While the rebirth of the term “tolerance” has been politically useful so far in
advocating equal rights for minority groups, it does not encourage open discourse. This does more harm
to the group in the long run, because the best way to deal with racism, homophobia, or sexism, isn’t by
silencing those speakers by the “I am offended, so I will not allow you to speak” narratives, but by
offering logical counterarguments to point out loopholes and contradictions in the opponents’
arguments. By virtue of such intellectual engagement, people can develop their moral autonomy to
stand up against such bigotry, arguably a better solution to group conflicts than exercising political
power to hide marginalized groups from offensive speeches.

            This book transformed the attitude I bring to academic environments: Previously, I often refused to
listen to other people’s viewpoints when they are too steadfast with their arguments. But as I
internalized the arguments Furedi makes, I became more open-minded toward opposing opinions. This
is the perspective that has helped me learn from others and makes the best of our contention. I no
longer come out of a debate frustrated with how ignorant others’ argument is, but now I appreciate
them for either proving that I’m wrong and in need of a better position or inducing deeper reflection
and commitment to my opinions.
