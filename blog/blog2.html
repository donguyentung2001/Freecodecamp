        <h1> Aristotle’s hylomorphic analysis and its implications for
            the problem of change 
            </h1>
        <article class="article1">
            <p> The aim of this paper is to resolve a possible contradiction in Aristotle’s response to the Eleatic philosopher Parmenides’ argument against the existence of change,
                 in the case of living beings’ coming to be without qualifications. This problem arises from Aristotle’s peculiar hylomorphic analysis of living beings, in which the relation between the soul and 
                 the body is radically different from that of non-living beings’ matter and form. Exploring and expanding on his investigation into the nutritive soul, the paper will provide a defense of Aristotle’s argument 
                 for the existence of change.</p>
            <p> Before stating why Aristotle’s hylomorphic analysis of living beings is problematic to his account of change, it is important to establish how Aristotle answers the challenge posed by Parmenides. Parmenides famously contends that “what comes to be must come to be from either what is or what is not, and coming to be is impossible in both cases; for what is cannot come to be (since it already is), while nothing can come to be from what is not (since there must be some subject)” (191a 25,29)<sup>1</sup> . 
                Aristotle responds to Parmenides by demonstrating that things exist in compound; thus, the dichotomy between “what is” and “what is not” is, first and foremost, incorrect, since a musical man can be a man and cannot be musical simultaneously: “In every case there must be some subject that comes to be; even if it is one in number, it is not one in form, since being a man is not the same as being an unmusical thing” (190a 15,18). </p>
            <p> More importantly, this leads Aristotle to his three principles of change: the underlying subject that persists through the change and the two contraries: “It is clear that some subject must underlie the contraries, and that there must be contraries” (191a 2,5). Aristotle then draws an important distinction between coming to be with qualifications and coming to be without qualifications (190a 31,35). The difference between the former and the latter is that in the first instance, the underlying subject is the form, while for the second case, the form only comes to be in the resultant subject. An example of coming to be with qualifications Aristotle provides is when the unmusical man becomes musical (190a 26,31). The underlying subject is the form of the man, while the property that changes is their musicality. On the other hand, when the bricks are arranged in a certain way to constitute a house, the subject that persists is the matter, that is, the bricks, yet this matter only acquires the form of a house in the end. The process of the bricks being built into a house is what Aristotle considers coming to be without qualifications. Thus far, the Aristotelian principles of change have demonstrated powerful explanatory power for both types of changes. </p>
            <p> Now, this paper argues that the Aristotelian analysis of change does not hold up, at least without further elaboration, in the case of living beings’ coming to be without qualifications. According to Aristotle, a living body is only a body insofar as it is ensouled; otherwise, it is only homonymously a body, that is, it is not a “real” body: “The sort of body that is potentially alive is not the one that has lost its soul but the one that has it” (412a 26,27). This relation between the body, as matter, and the soul, as form, drastically differs from that of matter and form of non-living beings. For example, before the bricks are built into a house, the bricks are still the bricks: their existence is independent of the form of the house. In contrast, Aristotle claims that a human body without its soul, or form, is not a potentially alive body. Furthermore, he believes that the soul cannot be separable from the body: “It is clear, then, that the soul is not separable from the body” (413a 3,5). These two premises imply that the soul and the body must either exist simultaneously or do not exist at all, because the existence of one presupposes the presence of the other.</p>
            <p> The analysis’ implication is problematic because the Aristotelian argument against Parmenides rests on the supposition that there is a substance persisting through the change, be it matter or form. However, in the case of coming to be without qualifications of living beings,  either both the matter, i.e. the physical body, and the form, i.e. the soul, remain through the change, or none of them exists in the first place. In the former instance, there is no coming-into-existence since both of them already are. In the latter case, if neither of the matter nor the soul is, then nothing can be generated from what is not. In other words, Aristotle seems to have to concede that there is no change in the coming to be without qualifications of living things, which significantly weakens his solution to Parmenides’ problem of change. </p>
            <p> In order to resolve this possible contradiction in Aristotle’s hylomorphic analysis, this paper proposes to investigate his thoughts on the nutritive soul, since the coming to be without qualifications of a living being obviously involves reproduction and nourishment. In particular, he claims that a living being’s nutritive soul produces its offspring: “Its functions are generation and the use of nourishment. For the most natural of all functions for a living thing, if it is to complete and not defective and does not come to be by chance, is to produce another thing of the same sort as itself” (415a 26,30). Thus, the form of the parent is the efficient cause of the offspring’s matter and form. </p>
            <p>However, knowing the efficient cause of living beings alone does not explain what the underlying subject that persists throughout the living beings’ coming to be without qualification, since the soul of the parent is not a part of the offspring. The paper’s response to this is that the soul of the parent turns some of the parent’s matter into the non-alive matter of the offspring. This non-alive matter is the matter at the level below the potentially alive, that is, the organic body of the living being. The soul of the parent accumulates matter into this non-alive body, until the non-alive body acquires both the matter of an organic body and the form of a living being simultaneously. What remains throughout this change is the non-alive body, since it is a subordinate matter component of the organic body. An analogy to illustrate this idea is that the clay is the matter component of the brick, but the clay is also the matter component of the house. The clay persists throughout the process of the workers transforming the clay into the bricks and the builders using the bricks to build a house. The same applies for the case of living beings: the non-alive matter persists throughout the process of the parent’s soul accumulating more matter to the non-alive matter and the matter turning into an ensouled organic body. </p>        
            <p>There are two reasons why this paper’s defense of Aristotle is important and significant. First, it resolves a contradiction that would otherwise greatly aggravate the soundness of his response to Parmenides’ argument. More importantly, the paper answers the problem by employing, for the most part, Aristotle’s arguments and not dismissing any of his ideas. Second, the paper’s argument is capable of explaining modern findings in medical research. It is scientifically established that the fetus, in the beginning of the pregnancy, must start out as a zygote, that is, the fusion of the mother’s egg and the father’s sperm. Thus, the Aristotelian analysis is consistent with empirical sciences insofar as the non-alive matter of the offspring is made of the parents’ matter. Furthermore, during pregnancy, the nutrients are transferred from the mother to the offspring through the placenta, and this process corresponds to the parent’s further accumulation of their matter into the non-alive body. Finally, when the fetus has the ability to feel sensations or perhaps even perceive their surroundings, the non-alive matter has now become subordinate to an ensouled organic body. In other words, the development of Aristotle’s argument in this paper provides the general framework that accounts for the coming to be without qualifications of living beings, while the natural sciences build more empirical details into this structure of analysis.</p>
            <p> In conclusion, there seems to be a contradiction in Aristotle’s hylomorphic analysis of living beings that weakens his account of change. However, this problem is resolved by appealing to his own description of the nutritive soul and recognizing that there are different levels of matter, such as clay is subordinate matter to bricks, while bricks are subordinate matter to the house. This paper’s argument is significant, because it strengthens Aristotle’s analysis of change without abandoning any of his ideas and explains empirically proven findings in medical studies. </p>
